# Tribute Page

This project is a prompt for a junior web developer to experiment with writing valid HTML with the aid of vanilla CSS. As with my tribute page, I did not aim for perfection. This time around, the main objective was to start understanding labeling and proper ways to implement classes into my code. 

I will be honest in saying even my very humble survey form was a great challange for me to get done. I look forward to returning it to perfect the styling as well as refine the HTML. I know it could be much better than it is now.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to try this prompt as well, I reccomend going to the FreeCodeCamp page here https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form

The Codepen included is where I drew the inspiration for my own tribute page. 

### Prerequisites

You can entirely do this project off codepen.io 

I used VS Code and Github, preferring to gain practice with version control and text editors as well.

## Built With
